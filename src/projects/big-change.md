Good Praxis is proud to have worked with Big Change to bring their latest
publictation to the web.

Since 2017 Big Change has been bringing together global partners who share a
commitment to reimagining education with and for young people. In 2020 they
published the New Education Story, identifying three drivers to transform
education systems: *purpose* - the goals and outcomes of education; *power* -
expanding who has voice and agency in education; and *practice* - unlocking
innovation that has transformative potential.

For the build we used Gatsby.js and React, which resulted in an fast-loading,
optimized and beautifly looking website.

The digital version of the publication is a result of a collaboration between
Good Praxis and [Noble Studio](https://www.noble.studio/) and you can view it
[here](https://big-change.org/new-education-story/).
