_[I Love You Infinity](https://iloveyouinfinity.com)_ is an autism awareness
campaign by copywriter [Lisa Berenson](http://thankyouforlookingatmybook.com/)
and her son William, in partnership with designer [Oriana
Gaeta](http://www.orianagaeta.com/) (RGA) and _Good Praxis_. The project is
inspired by the unique, mathematical way William expresses his love by counting
‘I love yous’.

The team recorded and programmed his voice to allow him to continue counting
forever online, to share the infinite love that can live inside an autistic
heart. They are also sending postcards with messages of love to people at home
to lift spirits in these uncertain times. Together they hope to raise awareness
around the different ways autistic minds express and experience and love.

The infinite audio began 30 March 2020 at 10:00 AM and will continue counting 'I
love yous' forever. The project aims to raise money for the National Autistic
Society. The team is also collecting and sharing real ASD stories of love
submitted by followers on _Instagram_.
