In March 2021 Good Praxis helped [YRS TRULY](https://yrstruly.uk/) launch the
"React to Survive" campaign for the Republic of Gamers, promoting their latest
gaming laptop, the ROG Strix SCAR 17.

The project involved building a website promoting their latest laptop, which
also included a simple, yet addictive interactive reaction game testing your
reaction time.

We also developed a custom Twitch extension to be used by streamers. The
extension allowed streamers to count their "close calls" and automatically
generate video clips from those exciting moments.

The campaign has been shortlisted for the [UK Content Awards 2021](https://ukcontentawards.com/2021-shortlist/)
and [UK Social Media Awards 2021](https://uksocialmediaawards.com/2021-shortlist/).
