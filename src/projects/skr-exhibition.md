The Stop Killer Robots (SKR) campaign raises awareness about the dangers of digital dehumanisation and autonomous weapon systems. 'Automated by Design' is an in-person exhibiton curated by Identity 2.0 for SKR in partnership with Amnesty International and Soka Gakkai International.

SKR commissioned us to build a site for a digital verison of the exhibition. This digital version included interactive videos, posters, and audio recordings.

The website was built using React.js, TypeScript, and Gatsby.
