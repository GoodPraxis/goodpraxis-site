We created a lightning-fast online publishing platform and online shop outlet
for Loading Bar, ‘the most popular & least intimidating gaming bars in Greater
London.’

Our remote Discovery session revealed Loading Bar needed a way for the
distributed team to publish articles, guides, sell merchandise, and quickly
broadcast venue updates — especially pressing in the current climate.

We based the UI and UX of the site around elements of the existing brand, being
careful to reinforce the playful and welcoming nature present in the bars
themselves.
