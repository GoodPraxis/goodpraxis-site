Skin Deep makes space for Black creatives and creatives of colour to work
towards justice through cultural production.

The team had outgrown their online space, and sought something more active and
alive that reflects the incredible work of their contributors. We looked to the
print magazine for inspiration, drawing on dynamic art direction, beautiful
photography and bold colour palettes derived from imagery. Storytelling remains
at the heart, with a reworked site structure based on categories to aid content
exploration. The new site is light, fast, and we were also really happy to bring
trainee developer Nafisa onboard for her first commercial project.
