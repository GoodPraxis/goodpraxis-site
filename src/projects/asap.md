ASAP PLZ is an authentic retro game about working in marketing. Made in
partnership with marketing gurus [YRS TRULY](https://yrstruly.uk/), it’s a
celebration of the good, the bad and the weird in the industry, released as a
fully working game for the legendary Mega Drive.

The project is first and foremost a collaboration between two like-minded
creative studios. Faced with months of social isolation, we decided to spend
some of that extra time on a passion project: a Wario Ware-inspired SEGA Mega
Drive game. We even created working cartridges to go with it - but since most
people probably don’t have 1989’s hottest console at hand, it’s also fully
playable in a browser at [asapthegame.com](https://asapthegame.com)

ASAP PLZ was launched to a great reception online and secured multiple pieces of
coverage within days, resulting in thousands of website views. ASAP PLZ was
featured in [Little Black
Book](https://www.lbbonline.com/news/get-your-office-fix-whilst-working-from-home-with-asap-plz)
and [The
Drum](https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2020/05/20/asap-plz-retro-game-about-working-marketing),
various gaming blogs, podcasts and YouTube videos. ASAP PLZ has also won
multiple design and web design awards, including Best UI Design, Best UX Design
and Best Innovation from CSS Design Awards and Honorable Mention from
[Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/sites/asap-plz-retro-office-game). It has
also scored multiple nominations and Website of the Day awards.
