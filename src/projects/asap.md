ASAP PLZ is a free game about working in marketing. Made in partnership with
marketing gurus [YRS TRULY](https://yrstruly.uk/), it’s a celebration of the
good, the bad and the weird in the industry.

The project is first and foremost a collaboration between two like-minded
creative studios. Faced with months of social isolation, we decided to spend
some of that extra time on a passion project: a Wario Ware-inspired SEGA Mega
Drive game. We even created working cartridges to go with it - but since most
people probably don’t have 1989’s hottest console at hand, it’s also fully
playable in a browser at asapthegame.com

ASAP PLZ was launched to a great reception online and secured multiple pieces of
coverage within days, resulting in thousands of website views. ASAP PLZ was
featured in Little Black Book and The Drum, various gaming blogs, podcasts and
YouTube videos. ASAP PLZ has also won multiple design and web design awards,
including Best UI Design, Best UX Design and Best Innovation from CSS Design
Awards and Special Kudos from Awwwards. It has also scored multiple nominations
and Website of the Day awards.
