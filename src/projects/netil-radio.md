Netil Radio have approached us to redesign and build a new version of their
website for their online community radio.

The main request was to make the website as straightforward as possible,
allowing visitors to listen to the radio straight away. We focused heavily on
the information architecture of the page, making sure it's clear who is currently
playing and what shows are coming next, without cluttering the interface. We also
applied heavy optimisations to make sure the loading time is kept as low as possible.

We looked to legendary product designer Dieter Rams' T3 Radio for inspiration,
which resulted in a minimal yet beautiful and functional website.
