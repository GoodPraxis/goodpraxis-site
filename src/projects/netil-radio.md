Netil Radio have approached us to redesign and build a new version of their website for their online radio.

The main request was to make the website as straightforward as possible, allowing visitors to listen to the radio straight away.

We looked to legendary product designer Dieter Rams' T3 Radio for inspiration, which resulted in a minimal yet beautiful and functional website.
