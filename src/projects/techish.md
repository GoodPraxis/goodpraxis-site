Tech–ish is a bespoke digital skills training scheme we’re delivering in
partnership with Outlandish Cooperative for Islington residents.

The pandemic brought about lots of job insecurity to many around the world and a
change in work available for the foreseeable future. This scheme was devised for
Islington residents that needed a helping hand in entering a new job market, or
for those that just wanted to gain confidence in using digital tools.

This scheme is largely signposting to existing content and we came up with an
identity that aims to communicate that whilst visually unify partners.
