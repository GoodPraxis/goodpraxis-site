Tech–ish is a bespoke digital skills training scheme we delivered in
partnership with Outlandish co-operative for Islington residents.

The global pandemic brought about lots of job insecurity to many around the
world and a change in work available for the foreseeable future. This scheme was
devised for Islington residents that needed a helping hand in entering a new job
market, or for those that just wanted to gain confidence in using digital tools.
