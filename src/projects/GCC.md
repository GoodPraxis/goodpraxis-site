GCC is a registered charity and an international community of arts organisations working to reduce the sector’s environmental impacts. GCC’s primary goal is to facilitate a reduction of the sector’s CO2e emissions by a minimum of 50% by 2030, as well as promoting zero waste. They develop and share best practices, and provide leadership on sector specific environmental issues. We were their technical partner in building the GCC carbon calculator, an application to help organisations track and reduce their CO₂e emissions.

In the application, users can create reports where they can record emissions data in simple-to-use input tables. Users from the same organisation can collborate on reports, and also invite guest collaborators from other organisations to have access to specfic reports. All the data is stored and used to produce detailed carbon emission breakdowns which can be viewed and downloaded by users. The application includes an automatically updated dashboard which allows users to visualise their carbon report summaries in intuitive data visualisations that help them track and achieve emissions targets. The carbon calculator also features dynamically generated data visualisations and carbon totals to enhance user engagement and provide feedback as data is being inputted.

The website was built as a monorepo, containing both the back-end and front-end for the project, enabling several coding efficiencies. For example, the front-end was built using TypeScript, and types were generated from the API layer to link the front-end and back-end, improving code robustness.
