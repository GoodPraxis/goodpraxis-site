Leading progressive think tank IPPR engaged us to design and build their
landmark Environmental Justice Commission digital report.

Entitled Fairness and Opportunity, it is a fully realised blueprint for the
transition to net zero. The report puts people at the heart of this plan, so we
focused on a seamless reading experience that holds the attention of time-poor
and easily distracted web users. Simple infographics, diagrams, subtle
animations and beautiful illustrations by Lottie Kingslake combine in this
interactive piece to ensure readers grasp the urgency and relevance of climate
change to them.
