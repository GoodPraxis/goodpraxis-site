FT Longitude and Ninety One engaged us to build a data visualisation experience to accompany their Planetary Pulse report, a report weighing the risks and opportunities of investing in an inclusive energy transition for asset owners.

The build combines attractive infographics, illustrations, and subtle animations to engage users and display a seamless, scroll-actuated reading experience.
