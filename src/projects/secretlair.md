Magic The Gatheringâ€™s Secret Lair is a series of limited edition collectable
card sets. In May 2020, Wizards of the Coast announced the Secret Lair Summer
Superdrop, featuring five distinct sets that ranged from tattoos to ornithology.

To support Secret Lair Summer Superdrop, we collaborated with [YRS
TRULY](http://yrstruly.uk/) to prepare a series of curated themed live shows on
Twitch. They featured creators from both the MTG sphere and outside of it,
involving them in quizzes and talent shows.

The activation took place on the Twitch channel of popular MTG creator Luis
Scott-Vargas, who was joined by fellow MTG streamer GabySpartz, as well as
gaming journalist and host Alysia Judge. Every day, a different creator would
join them for a talent show. Guests included tattoo artist Rebecca Vincent, body
painter Melissa Croft, DIY YouTuber Odin Makes and illustrator Dan Mumford.

To maximise engagement, we created a custom app for Twitch in Python allowing
viewers to vote and actively participate in the quiz as part of the stream. We
also developed the branding and design of the Twitch overlays.
