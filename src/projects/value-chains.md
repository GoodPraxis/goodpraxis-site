How can we better address hidden child labour? A free, interactive tool to
identify challenges and potential interventions at the origin of commodity
supply chains.

This tool has been developed as part of the 3 year UK Aid funded
[Partnership Against Child Exploitation](https://www.pace-consortium.org/)
programme, addressing the worst forms of child labour
in three fragile African contexts of Central African Republic, Democratic
Republic of Congo and Ethiopia.

The tool combines an innovative, bottom-up supply chain mapping approach with
labour market & value chain analyses of tantalum mining in DRC and sesame
farming in Ethiopia. This new approach helps reveal where child labour can often
operate invisibly and undetected in the supply chains of our food and
electronics, which traditional top-down supply chain mapping methodologies
struggle to identify.

Typically, the supply chain is understood end-to-end, starting with the final
product and looking top-down, with the origin or raw commodity level at the
furthest point from it. However, child labour is primarily a geographic
challenge. So, to meaningfully understand and address it, a new model is
required to better identify the key stages of the supply chain, and particularly
to see origin agricultural communities and mines as a critical part of the
industry they enable.

This can help identify opportunities for companies, investors and others to work
together across industries to see better and faster impact where child labour
exists. We need to quickly move from a focus on finding and assessing the risks
– to identifying effective interventions and minimising unintended consequences.

Systemic and systematic approaches are required at the local level, while also
identifying dynamics that impact children both positively and negatively across
the whole fabric of the local community and economy.

[The site](https://valuechains.pace-consortium.org/)
draws together research that focuses on identifying pathways to remove
children from the worst forms of child labour and to prevent it re-occurring -
with recommendations for safe and decent alternatives.

It is intended to help give organisations of all shapes, sizes and stages of the
supply chain an easy to access way of engaging with a complex issue, and is
primarily aimed at engaging investors, the private sector and other stakeholders
to identify where the WFCL can be present in products and supply chains, learn
about the root causes at community, national and global levels, and to provide
recommendations on how committed and effective multi-stakeholder partnerships
can drive holistic and transformative change in the communities where raw
materials are sourced.

The project has been built in collaboration with [Noble Studio](https://www.noble.studio/).
