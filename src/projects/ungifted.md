For two years now Good Praxis has helped [Do The Green Thing](https://dothegreenthing.com/)
build their [Ungifted Secret Santa](https://ungiftedsecretsanta.com) campaign.

Instead of buying a pointless gift that may be thrown away, Ungifted encourages
people to think a little differently and gift their time, creativity, comedic
streak, or company instead.

Good Praxis built a custom platform, which allows people to create groups, allocate
"secret santas" and choose one of several quirky gifts to be given during to their
friends and collegues.
