For two years now Good Praxis has helped [Do The Green Thing](https://dothegreenthing.com/)
build their [Ungifted Secret Santa](https://ungiftedsecretsanta.com) campaign.

Instead of buying a pointless gift that may be thrown away, Ungifted encourages
people to think a little differently and gift their time, creativity, comedic
streak, or company instead.

Good Praxis built a custom platform, which allows people to create groups, allocate
"secret santas" and choose one of several quirky gifts to be given during to their
friends and collegues.

On the technical side, we used a Python + React stack to record and manage groups
and their gift choices.
