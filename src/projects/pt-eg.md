The Prince's Trust, one of the biggest charities in the United Kingdom, has
comissioned us to create a custom made administration panel to manage their
"Enterprise Game" campaign.

The campaign focuses on teaching school children entrepreneurship by providing
them a game simulating running a popup store. The admin panel allows teachers
and staff members to manage challenges and competitions across different
regions, and record pupil performance.

The admin panel was built on top of a Flask (Python) and React stack. We created
a proprietary API to manage all the data, allowing flexible access.

The system is used by both the British and International branches of the
charity, and by staff members based in many different countries.
