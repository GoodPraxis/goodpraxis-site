  Good Praxis
</h1>

This is the main repository of the [Good Praxis website](https://goodpraxis.coop)
made using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

## Quick start

1.  **Install dependencies.**

    Make sure you have Node.js and NPM installed, then install all dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into the project's directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

## What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

1. **`/__mocks__`**: Contains mocks used for testing.

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

1.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

1. **`/static`**: All the static files used by the site, like fonts and logos.

1.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

1.  **`.gitlab-ci.yml`**: Settings for the GitLab CI.

1.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

1.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

1. **`jest-preprocess.js`**: Preprocessing setup code for Jest, used for testing.

1. **`jest.config.js`**: Configuration file for Jest, used for testing.

1.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

1. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

1. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.
